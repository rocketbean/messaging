# chasi
an **RESTApi** boilerplate, or template for **node.js**,  best starting point for dev's who already have the knowledge on how MVC framework works,
in terms of:
- Database
- Model
- Controller
- Routing
- Middlewares
- Bindings
 
It is basically just like mvc frameworks,
but right as of this moment, please slash out the [view] part. as this template only supports **Rest**,

*hopeful that i can add that soon.*

it might still be missing some features, please take a note on that, and if you're interested, we can open a discussion about that.
i'll release some API docs, please checkout: https://castmonkeys.com/
*and find the community for chasi, as i'll be posting any upcommings in that website, 
and plus you can also add some discussions if you have any suggestions*

# Installation
  fork this repo,
  then run npm i
  
# Notes
  as of this moment, MongoDB is the only database it supports, though Databases can be imported directly unto controller,
  so you can have your DB wrapper *(only if you are not using MongoDB as your database)*
  
  Might release a version built with TS. this repo was built in the most simpliest way to support any type of devs.
# Requirements 
this template requires 
- nodejs: ^14.0.0
- mongoDB: ^3.0.0
